# USACO Repo - Neil Song

## Description

This is a (partial) dump repo of all my USACO solutions - C++ projects and solutions. Do not expect everything to work, some code is out of date, some was never finished.  
Either way, I will not be maintaining this repo.

## Format
Each folder represents a Visual Studio Solution for a different category of USACO problems - further descriptions are below.
